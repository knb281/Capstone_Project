Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Home Credit Group

Introduction

Welcome to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) section of the Home Credit Group project! In this repository, we aim to understand and analyze the data provided by Home Credit to predict clients' repayment abilities and improve their loan experience.

Dataset Overview

The dataset provided by Home Credit includes alternative data such as telco and transactional information. This data is crucial for predicting clients' repayment abilities and ensuring a positive loan experience for the unbanked population.

Project Goals

Our primary goals for this exploratory data analysis are:

Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Identify any data preprocessing steps required.
Explore relationships between variables to gain insights.
Visualize key patterns and trends in the data.
Repository Structure

notebooks: This folder includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, dataset, and EDA process.

Data Exploration Steps

Data Loading: We will start by loading the dataset into our analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types if necessary.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and analyze descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical variables.
Univariate Analysis: Explore individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between pairs of variables using visualizations (scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.).
Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships involving multiple variables to uncover patterns and trends.
Visualization: Create visualizations (bar charts, histograms, box plots, etc.) to communicate insights effectively.

Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis phase is crucial for understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and preparing the data for predictive modeling. By following these steps, we aim to unlock the full potential of Home Credit's data and contribute to improving financial inclusion for the unbanked population.
